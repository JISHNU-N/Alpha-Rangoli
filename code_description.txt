                     *******alpha rangoli********
This code is used to print alpha rangoli pattern in python only using the basic list and string operations.
alpha rangoli forms a rhombus of every single letter around the center letter a.
It's quite a view to watch it.
///////you have to enter the input number from 1 to 26. Because we only have 26 English alphabets,
In here I used the lower case letters\\\\\\\\\\


for eg:
          for an input of 9 the o/p will be like This

          ----------------i----------------
          --------------i-h-i--------------
          ------------i-h-g-h-i------------
          ----------i-h-g-f-g-h-i----------
          --------i-h-g-f-e-f-g-h-i--------
          ------i-h-g-f-e-d-e-f-g-h-i------
          ----i-h-g-f-e-d-c-d-e-f-g-h-i----
          --i-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i--
          i-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i
          --i-h-g-f-e-d-c-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i--
          ----i-h-g-f-e-d-c-d-e-f-g-h-i----
          ------i-h-g-f-e-d-e-f-g-h-i------
          --------i-h-g-f-e-f-g-h-i--------
          ----------i-h-g-f-g-h-i----------
          ------------i-h-g-h-i------------
          --------------i-h-i--------------
          ----------------i----------------

  As you can see the code prints the pattern up to the 9th letter i.
